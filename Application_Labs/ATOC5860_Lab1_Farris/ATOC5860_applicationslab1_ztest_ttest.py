# ##### Originally coded by Prof. Kay (CU)
# ##### last updated January 16, 2024
# 
# ### LEARNING GOALS:
# 1) Use an ipython notebook to read in a netcdf file, make line plots and histograms, and calculate statistics
# 2) Calculate statistical significance of the changes in a standardized mean using a z-statistic and a t-statistic
# 3) Calculate confidence intervals for model-projected global warming using z-statistic and t-statistic
# 
# ### DATA and UNDERLYING SCIENCE:  
# You will be plotting munged climate model output from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble Project. The Large Ensemble Project includes an initial condition ensemble of fully coupled climate model simulations for the period 1920-2100 (note: only the original 30 are provided here). Each individual ensemble member is subject to the same radiative forcing scenario (historical up to 2005 and high greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP8.5) thereafter), but begins from a slightly different initial atmospheric state (created by randomly perturbing temperatures at the level of round-off error). In the notebook, you will compare the ensemble remembers with a 2600-year-long model simulation having constant pre-industrial (1850) radiative forcing conditions (i.e., perpetual 1850). By comparing the ensemble members to each other and to the 1850 control, you can assess the climate change in the presence of internal climate variability.

## It's always a good idea to plot your data before you start doing any calculations.  "Look at your data"!
## Let's make a quick line plot of global annual mean temperature timeseries 
## from the 1850 control and the ensemble members.
## Not the prettiest plot... e.g., font is WAY TO SMALL ... but it works to "look at our data :)"
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = [22,4]

# ### LEARNING GOAL #2 - Assess global warming and compare it to the pre-industrial climate

# First - Use the 2600-year long 1850 control run to calculate population statistics with constant forcing (in the absence of climate change). Find the population mean and population standard deviation for CESM1 global annual mean surface temperature. Standardize the data and again find the population mean and population standard deviation.  Plot a histogram of the standardized data. Is the distribution Gaussian?

# In[4]:


#### With the 1850 control we have the opportunity to calculate close to population statistics with constant forcing.
#### Let's find the population mean and population standard deviation from the 1850 control.  
gts_1850_mean=np.mean(gts_1850)
gts_1850_std=np.std(gts_1850)
print(f'Mean 1850 global mean surface temperature: {np.round(gts_1850_mean.values)}')
print(f'Standard deviation in 1850 global mean surface temperature: {np.round(gts_1850_std.values,1)}')


# In[5]:


#### Standardize the data and plot a histogram
gts_1850_norm=(gts_1850-gts_1850_mean)/gts_1850_std
gts_1850_norm_mean=np.mean(gts_1850_norm).values
gts_1850_norm_std=np.std(gts_1850_norm).values
print("Standardized 1850 global mean surface temperature:")
print(f'mean: {np.round(gts_1850_norm_mean,2)}')
print(f'std: {np.round(gts_1850_norm_std,2)}')

xinc = np.arange(-3,3,.25)
hx=np.histogram(gts_1850_norm,xinc)
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = [5,5]
plt.bar(hx[1][:-1],hx[0],edgecolor = 'r', color = [], width = .25, linewidth = 2);
plt.ylabel('Number of Samples');
plt.xlabel('Standardized Value (Z)');

## another histogram option to try (might be deprecated)
#xinc = np.arange(-3,3,.25);
#plt.hist(gts_1850_norm,xinc);
#plt.ylabel('Number of Samples');
#plt.xlabel('Standardized Value (Z)');


# Next, calculate global warming in the first ensemble member over a given time period defined by the startyear and endyear variables.  Compare the warming in this first ensemble member with the 1850 control run statistics and assess if the warming is statistically significant. Use hypothesis testing and state the 5 steps.  What is your null hypothesis?  Try using a z-statistic (appropriate for N>30) and a t-statistic (appropriate for N<30). What is the probability that the warming in the first ensemble member occurred by chance? Change the startyear and endyear variables â€“ When does global warming become statistically significant in the first ensemble member?  

# In[6]:


### Next let's calculate the global warming in the first ensemble member over a given time period.
### Our end goal is compare this warming to the 1850 control run and assess if the warming is statistically significant.

### Start by standardizing member 1 data using the 1850 control mean and standard deviation
startyear=1975 ##CHANGE ME
endyear=1985   ##CHANGE ME
nyrs=(endyear-startyear)
print(f'nyears: {nyrs}')
gts_mem1=gts.sel(member=1).sel(year=slice(startyear,endyear-1))
print(gts_mem1)
gts_mem1_norm=(gts_mem1-gts_1850_mean)/gts_1850_std

print(f'Standardized mean CESM LE member 1: {np.round(np.mean(gts_mem1_norm).values,2)}')

## plot a histogram to see the range of values
xinc = np.arange(-20,20,.25)
hx=np.histogram(gts_mem1_norm,xinc);

## What is the probability that the mean annual global mean temperature was X assuming no global warming?
## Test the null hypothesis that the sample mean is equal to the population mean.
## Assume that the Global Mean Annual Temperature is standard normal. 

## Using Barnes equation (83) to calculate probability using z-statistic
sample_mean=np.mean(gts_mem1_norm).values
print(f'sample_mean: {np.round(sample_mean,2)}')
population_mean=gts_1850_norm_mean
population_std=gts_1850_norm_std
xstd=population_std/np.sqrt(nyrs)
z=(sample_mean-population_mean)/xstd
print("Z-statistic:")
print(np.round(z,2))
print("Probability (percent):")
prob=(1-stats.norm.cdf(z))*100
print(np.round(prob,2))

## Using Barnes equation (96) to calculate probability using the t-statistic
sample_mean=np.mean(gts_mem1_norm).values
sample_std=np.std(gts_mem1_norm).values
print("T-statistic:")
t=(sample_mean-population_mean)/(sample_std/(np.sqrt(nyrs-1)))
print(np.round(t,2))
print("Probability (percent):")
prob=(1-stats.t.cdf(t,nyrs-1))*100
print(np.round(prob,2))

######## example using python function = improved after discussions with Yu-Wen in office hours :)
print('Try using a ttest function from python - using the p-value')
#stats.ttest_ind(gts_1850_norm,gts_mem1_norm)

tw=stats.ttest_ind(gts_mem1_norm,gts_1850_norm,equal_var = False) 
#Note: When equal_var is false (defaults to true), you assume the underlying population variances are NOT equal 
## and this function then uses Welch's T-test
print(stats.ttest_ind(gts_mem1_norm,gts_1850_norm,equal_var = False)) 

print(tw.pvalue)

if tw.pvalue < 0.05:
    print('Can reject the null hypthesis.')
else:
    print('Cannot reject the null hypthesis.')    
    
#### can also compare tstatistic to tcrit to evaluate statistical significance.

tcrit=stats.t.ppf(0.975,nyrs-1)
print(f'tcrit: {np.round(tcrit,2)}')

if np.abs(tw.statistic) > np.abs(tcrit):
    print('Can reject the null hypthesis.')
else:
    print('Cannot reject the null hypthesis.')

# Many climate modeling centers run only a handful of ensemble members for climate change projections. Given that the CESM Large Ensemble has lots of members, you can calculate the warming over the 21st century and place confidence intervals in that warming by assessing the spread across ensemble members.  Calculate confidence intervals using both a z-statistic and a t-statistic.  How different are they?  Plot a histogram of global warming in the ensemble members â€“ Is a normal distribution a good approximation? Re-do your confidence interval analysis by assuming that you only had 6 ensemble members or 3 ensemble members.  How many members do you need?  Look at the difference between a 95% confidence interval and a 99% confidence interval.
